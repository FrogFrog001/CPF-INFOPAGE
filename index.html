        <p>Using activated carbon, sand, and gravel, the CPF filters dirty particles and bacteria out of the water. One of the components within the filter is activated carbon. The carbon (charcoal), is not very difficult to create and obtain. This part can be replaced with most santiary (safe) form of activated carbon. Activated carbon will filter out harmful chemicals in the water, which  can cause various forms of poisoning and health hazards. Another component is sand. It will filter out small, finer particles and potentially harmful bacteria that resides in the water. Sand is not uncommon, but it is important that the sand is clean and not contaminated. The third component is rather common (gravel). It will eliminate larger sediments, such as plastic chunks, wood chips, sticks, and so on. These components should be placed in an order such as the following: (Top layer) gravel, sand, charcoal, sand, charcoal (bottom). This design should successfully filter and eliminate harmful substances from the water, making it much safer to be consumed. In addition, it is a unique design. There are two carbon & sand layers, which help maximize the effectiveness of the water.</p>
